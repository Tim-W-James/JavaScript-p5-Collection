# Artist Statement

My piece is designed to advertise a fictional brand of running shoes called Zike (a play on Nike).  A consumer looking for running shoes would likely have one primary goal: which shoes will let me run the fastest?  I wanted this notion of speed to be the focus of my piece.  The added element of interaction allowed me to directly involve the viewer, giving the impression that they would be able to run significantly faster if they bought these shoes.

I decided to take this concept of speed to a greatly exaggerated level in order to create a memorable experience.  The piece shows 'you' running around the entire Earth, reaching absurd speeds that is almost comedic.  When higher and higher speeds are reached, the Earth gradually turns red and burns up, creating additional humour.  This illustrates a simple but clear and memorable message, along with the slick logo and slogan.

In order to 'run' and gain speed, the user must interact with the piece my pressing keys, and higher speeds are reached by pressing keys faster.  This involves the user, giving them an immediate sense of momentum they are creating.
